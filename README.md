# About

"QuizReact" is a react app that pulls 5 random questions from the OTDB API for the user to answer. This is a final solo project apart of Scrimba's tutorial "Learn react for free" (https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) to further develop and test my React skills. 

Scrimba provided a figma file for the design of the app, and also described some of the main features the app should have.

# Features

 * Loads questions and answers from the OTDB API.
 * Options page which allows you to set category, difficulty, and type of questions.
